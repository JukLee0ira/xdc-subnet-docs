# Motivation

We design a subnet for XDC enterprise customers to have:
1.	a sovereign, permissioned, and high-performing blockchain (the subnet) fully owned by the customer
2.	a security level of the subnet transactions equivalent to the sum security of the subnet AND the XDC mainnet
3.	native EVM smart contract support
4.	total privacy (i.e., no visibility) of the subset transactions on the XDC mainnet
