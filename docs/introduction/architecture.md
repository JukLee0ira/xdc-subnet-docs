# Architecture


The architecture consists of the following key components owned by the customer:
1.	a subnet driven by the XDC2.0 consensus engine, with system configurations tailored for the customer
2.	a relayer program that checkpoint critical consensus data of the subnet to the XDC mainnet
3.	a smart contract in the XDC mainnet that verifies and records the checkpoints
4.	wallet APIs that enable additional protection of subnet transaction from the XDC mainnet
