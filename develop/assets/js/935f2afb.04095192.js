The Epoch and Epoch gap blocks stores important information regarding subnet validators selection.

Instead, they should only checkpoint snapshots of their ledger to XDC in order to extract XDC\'s security.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"usage/confirmation_checker":{"id":"usage/confirmation_checker","title":"Confirmation Checker","description":"After navigating with the left menu bar to the Confirmation Checker of the Subnet, this will be shown.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"usage/homepage":{"id":"usage/homepage","title":"Homepage","description":"Once subnet is successfully deployed.
